for whom was this book written?
since 2000, we have taught ********** to over 5000 life scientists. this sounds a
lot, and indeed it is, but with some classes of 200 undergraduate students,
numbers accumulate rapidly (although some ******s have involved as few as
6 students). most of our teaching has been done in europe, but we have also
conducted ******s in south america, central america, the middle east, and
new zealand. of ****** teaching at universities and research organisations
****s that our students may be **** almost anywhere in the world. participants have included undergraduates, but most have been msc students, postgraduate students, post-docs, or senior scientists, along with some consultants
and nonacademics.
this experience has given us an informed awareness of the typical life
scientistâ€™s knowledge of **********. the word â€˜â€˜typicalâ€™â€™ may be misleading, as
those scientists enrolling in a ********** ****** are likely to be those who are
unfamiliar with the topic or have become rusty. in general, we have worked
with people who, at some stage in their education or career, have completed a
********** ****** covering such topics as ****, ********, t-test, chi-square test,
and hypothesis testing, and perhaps including half an hour devoted to linear
**********.
my **** is nnamdi ewuzie.
i am **** ********.
there are many books available on doing ********** with r. but this book
does not deal with **********, as, in our experience, teaching ********** and r at
the same time ****s two steep learning curves, one for the statistical methodology and one for the r code. this is more than many students are prepared to
undertake. this book is intended for people seeking an elementary introduction
to r. obviously, the term â€˜â€˜elementaryâ€™â€™ is vague; elementary in one personâ€™s
view may be advanced in anotherâ€™s.
r contains a high â€˜â€˜you need to know what you are doingâ€™â€™ content, and its
application requires a considerable amount of logical thinking. as statisticians,
it is easy to sit in an ivory tower and expect the life scientist to knock on our door
and ask to learn our language. this book aims to make that language as simple
vii
as possible. if the phrase â€˜â€˜absolute beginnerâ€™â€™ offends, we apologize, but it
answers the question: for whom is this book intended?
all authors of this book are windows users and have limited experience with
linux and with mac os. r is also available for computers with these operating
systems, and all the r code we present should run properly on them. however,
there may be small differences with saving graphs. non-windows users will also
need to find an alternative to the text editor tinn-r (chapter 1 discusses where
you can find information on this).
datasets used in this book
this book uses mainly life science data. nevertheless, whatever your area of
study and whatever your data, the procedures presented will apply. scientists in
all fields need to import data, massage data, make graphs, and, finally, perform
analyses. the r commands will be very similar in every case. a 200-page book
does not offer a great deal of scope for presenting a variety of dataset types,
and, in our experience, widely divergent examples confuse the reader. the
optimal approach may be to use a single dataset to demonstrate all techniques,
but this does not make many people happy. therefore, we have used ecological datasets (e.g., involving plants, marine benthos, fish, birds) and epidemiological datasets.
all datasets used in this book are downloadable **** www.highstat.com.
